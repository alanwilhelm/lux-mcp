## Integration Strategies

### Hybrid Approach

Combine tools for optimal results:

1. **Start with planner** - Get high-level structure
2. **Use sequential_thinking** - For sensitive parts
3. **Switch to sequential_thinking_external** - For detailed exploration
4. **Finish with traced_reasoning** - For critical validation

### Progressive Enhancement

Start simple, add complexity as needed:

```python
def progressive_reasoning(problem, sensitivity_level):
    if sensitivity_level == "public":
        # Start with AI assistance
        tool = "sequential_thinking_external"
        params = {"use_llm": True, "model": "gpt-4o"}
    elif sensitivity_level == "internal":
        # Use AI but with more control
        tool = "sequential_thinking_external"
        params = {"use_llm": True, "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.3}
    elif sensitivity_level == "confidential":
        # Manual only
        tool = "sequential_thinking"
        params = {}
    else:  # "critical"
        # Full monitoring
        tool = "traced_reasoning"
        params = {"guardrails": {...}}
    
    return tool, params
```
