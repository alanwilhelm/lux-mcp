- More efficient thinking process
- Better token utilization

**O3-Pro**
- Extended reasoning time for maximum accuracy
- Higher token consumption
- Longer response times (30 seconds to several minutes)
- Optimized for correctness over speed

### 4. Reliability & Honesty

#### Hallucination Rates
- **GPT-5 thinking**: ~6x fewer hallucinations than O3
- **GPT-5**: 45% fewer factual errors than GPT-4o
- **GPT-5 thinking**: 80% fewer factual errors than O3
- **Winner**: GPT-5 by significant margin

#### Deception & Honesty
- **GPT-5**: 2.1% deception rate in production
- **O3**: 4.8% deception rate
- **GPT-5**: Better at recognizing impossible tasks
- **Winner**: GPT-5

### 5. Real-World Performance

According to OpenAI's evaluation on 1000+ economically valuable prompts:
- External experts preferred **GPT-5 Pro over O3-Pro 67.8% of the time**
- GPT-5 Pro made **22% fewer major errors**
- GPT-5 excelled particularly in health, science, mathematics, and coding

### 6. Context Windows

**GPT-5**
- 272,000 tokens context window
- 200,000 tokens max output

**O3-Pro**
- 200,000 tokens context window
- 100,000 tokens max output

**Winner**: GPT-5 with 36% larger context

### 7. Availability & Access

**GPT-5**
- Default model in ChatGPT (replaced O3)
- Available to all tiers (Free, Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise)
- GPT-5 Pro available to Pro subscribers

**O3-Pro**
- Being phased out, replaced by GPT-5 Pro
- Still accessible temporarily for Pro users
- Will be fully deprecated

## Conclusion

**GPT-5 is definitively superior to O3-Pro** based on:

1. **Better Performance**: Higher scores on most benchmarks
2. **Greater Efficiency**: 50-80% fewer tokens for same results
3. **Higher Reliability**: 6x fewer hallucinations, 2x less deception
4. **User Preference**: 67.8% preference rate by experts
5. **Larger Context**: 272K vs 200K tokens
6. **Unified System**: Combines fast and deep reasoning seamlessly
7. **Future-Proof**: O3-Pro is being replaced by GPT-5 Pro

### When to Use Each

**Use GPT-5**:
- General purpose queries
- Multimodal tasks
- Health and medical questions
- Coding and development
- Creative writing
- Fast responses needed
- Production applications

**Use O3-Pro** (while still available):
- Maximum depth reasoning on single problems
- Mathematical proofs requiring extended computation
- When you specifically need the O3 reasoning style
- Legacy applications built for O3

### The Verdict

OpenAI's own statement is clear: **"GPT-5 is our smartest, fastest, most useful model yet"** and it officially replaces O3 as the default. The company has unified the best of both GPT and O-series into GPT-5, making it the clear choice for virtually all use cases.

The transition from O3-Pro to GPT-5 Pro represents not just an incremental improvement but a fundamental advancement in AI capabilities, combining superior intelligence with better efficiency and reliability.
