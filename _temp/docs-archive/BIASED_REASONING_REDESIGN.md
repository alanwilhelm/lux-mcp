# Biased Reasoning Redesign - Full Transparency

## Current Flow (Hidden)
```
1. Generate reasoning step (internal)
2. Check for bias (internal) 
3. Generate correction if needed (internal)
4. Return combined result
```

## New Flow (Fully Visible)
```
Step 1: User provides query
Step 2: Model generates reasoning → VISIBLE
Step 3: Bias checker analyzes Step 2 → VISIBLE
Step 4: If biased, generate correction → VISIBLE
Step 5: User provides guidance for next step
Step 6: Model continues reasoning → VISIBLE
Step 7: Bias checker analyzes Step 6 → VISIBLE
...and so on
```

## Example Interaction

### Step 1 - Initial Query
```json
{
  "tool": "biased_reasoning",
  "arguments": {
    "step_type": "query",
    "content": "Should we migrate to Tailwind v4?",
    "step_number": 1,
    "session_id": "tailwind-analysis"
  }
}
```

### Step 2 - Primary Reasoning
```json
Response: {
  "step_type": "reasoning",
  "step_number": 2,
  "content": "Tailwind v4 offers significant improvements...",
  "model_used": "o3-pro",
  "next_action": "bias_check"
}
```

### Step 3 - Bias Check (VISIBLE!)
```json
Response: {
  "step_type": "bias_analysis",
  "step_number": 3,
  "analysis": {
    "has_bias": true,
    "bias_types": ["ConfirmationBias", "AvailabilityBias"],
    "severity": "Medium",
    "explanation": "The reasoning focuses only on benefits...",
    "suggestions": ["Consider migration costs", "Evaluate breaking changes"]
  },
  "model_used": "o4-mini",
  "next_action": "correction_needed"
}
```

### Step 4 - Correction (VISIBLE!)
```json
Response: {
  "step_type": "correction",
  "step_number": 4,
  "original": "Tailwind v4 offers significant improvements...",
  "corrected": "While Tailwind v4 offers improvements, we must consider...",
  "model_used": "o4-mini",
  "next_action": "continue_reasoning"
}
```

### Step 5 - User Guidance
```json
{
  "tool": "biased_reasoning",
  "arguments": {
    "step_type": "guidance",
    "content": "Good correction. Now analyze the specific CSS architecture changes",
    "step_number": 5,
    "session_id": "tailwind-analysis"
  }
}
```

## Benefits of Full Visibility

1. **See Bias Detection in Action**
   - Watch how biases are identified
   - Understand why something is considered biased
   - Learn from the bias patterns

2. **Transparent Corrections**
   - See original vs corrected reasoning
   - Understand what changed and why
   - Evaluate if correction is appropriate

3. **Fine-Grained Control**
   ```
   User sees: "High confirmation bias detected"
   User can: "Let's explore counterarguments more deeply"
   ```

4. **Educational Value**
   - Learn about different bias types
   - See how reasoning can be improved
   - Develop better critical thinking

5. **Quality Assurance**
   - Verify bias checker is working correctly
   - Ensure corrections maintain meaning
   - Track bias patterns over time

## Implementation Structure

```rust
enum StepType {
    Query,           // Initial question
    Reasoning,       // Primary model reasoning
    BiasAnalysis,    // Bias check result (VISIBLE)
    Correction,      // Corrected reasoning (VISIBLE)
    Guidance,        // User input
    Synthesis,       // Final compilation
}

struct BiasedReasoningStep {
    step_number: u32,
    step_type: StepType,
    content: String,
    metadata: StepMetadata,
}
```

## Step Counting Example
```
1. Query: "Should we migrate?"
2. Reasoning: "Yes, because..."
3. Bias Analysis: "Confirmation bias detected"
4. Correction: "Let's consider both sides..."
5. Guidance: "Focus on performance impacts"
6. Reasoning: "Performance-wise..."
7. Bias Analysis: "No significant bias"
8. Guidance: "Now consider costs"
9. Reasoning: "Cost analysis shows..."
10. Bias Analysis: "Anchoring bias on initial numbers"
11. Correction: "Adjusting for market rates..."
12. Synthesis: "Final recommendation..."
```

Each step is visible, traceable, and guidable!
