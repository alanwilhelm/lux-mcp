# Monitoring Progress with o3-pro

## Progress Indicators Added

All tools now show progress indicators when using o3 models:

### What You'll See in Logs

When using o3-pro, the logs will show:

```
🚀 Sending planning request to o3-pro (max_tokens: 32768)
⏳ Deep reasoning in progress. This is normal for o3 models...
💭 The model is thinking deeply about your question...
✅ o3-pro responded in 2m 34s
```

## How to Monitor Progress

### Option 1: View Claude Desktop Logs (Recommended)

Open a terminal and watch the logs in real-time:

```bash
# macOS
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-*.log | grep -E "⏳|🚀|✅|💭"
```

This will show you:
- 🚀 When a request is sent
- ⏳ Warning about long processing time
- 💭 Confirmation it's thinking
- ✅ When it completes (with time)

### Option 2: Run Server Manually with Logs

If you want more detailed logs:

```bash
# Stop Claude Desktop first
# Then run manually:
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/lux-mcp 2>&1 | tee lux-progress.log
```

## Understanding the Timing

- **o3-pro**: 30 seconds to 5 minutes per call
- **o3**: 20 seconds to 2 minutes per call
- **o4-mini**: 5-15 seconds per call
- **gpt-4**: 2-5 seconds per call

## Tips

1. **Be Patient**: o3-pro is doing deep reasoning. The wait is normal.

2. **Watch the Logs**: Keep a terminal open with:
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-*.log
   ```

3. **Check for Errors**: If it takes longer than 5 minutes, check for timeout errors

4. **Use Faster Models for Testing**: When developing, use:
   ```
   model: "gpt-4"
   ```

5. **Cost Awareness**: o3-pro is expensive. Each call can cost several dollars.

## Example Log Output

Here's what you'll see in the logs for a typical o3-pro planner call:

```
2025-07-27T03:15:23.456Z INFO Planner request - Step 2/10, Model: o3-pro, Temperature: 0.7, Session: Some("abc123")
2025-07-27T03:15:23.457Z INFO ⏳ Using o3-pro - this may take 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Processing...
2025-07-27T03:15:23.458Z INFO 🚀 Sending planning request to o3-pro (max_tokens: 32768)

2025-07-27T03:17:45.123Z INFO ✅ o3-pro responded in 2m 21s
```

## If Something Goes Wrong

If you don't see progress indicators:
1. Ensure you're using the latest build
2. Check RUST_LOG is set to "info" or "debug"
3. Look for error messages in the logs
4. Try with a faster model first to verify connectivity
