# Lux MCP - Project Summary

## What We Built

We've created a new Rust-based MCP server called **Lux** that illuminates cognitive patterns to prevent overthinking. This focused tool brings light to AI reasoning by:

1. **Illuminating thought paths**: Shines light on each step of the reasoning process
2. **Shadow detection**: Identifies when thoughts circle in darkness or follow false lights
3. **Performance through Rust**: Native speed ensures real-time illumination without lag

## Key Components

### 1. Illumination Engine (Metachain)
- Guides thoughts step-by-step with cognitive light
- Provides brightness indicators for thought clarity
- Integrates shadow detection to maintain illuminated paths

### 2. Shadow Detection Monitor
- **Circular Shadow Detection**: Identifies when thoughts loop in darkness (>85% similarity)
- **False Light Detection**: Spots when reasoning follows distractors (<30% relevance)
- **Brightness Tracking**: Monitors clarity and coherence over time
- **Illumination Guidance**: Provides refocus beacons and consolidation glows

### 3. MCP Protocol Implementation
- Full JSON-RPC support over stdio
- Two tools: `lux_think` and `illumination_status`
- Two prompts: `illuminate_thinking` and `analyze_illumination`

## Running the Server

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Test the server**:
   ```bash
   ./test_server.sh
   ```

3. **Use with Claude Desktop**:
   - Copy the example configuration to your Claude config
   - Update the path to match your installation
   - Restart Claude Desktop

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "tool": "lux_think",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "I need to design a distributed cache system",
    "thought_number": 1,
    "total_thoughts": 8,
    "next_thought_needed": true,
    "monitor_overthinking": true
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

This is a foundational implementation. Future illumination enhancements:

1. **LLM Integration**: Connect to language models for actual light-guided reasoning
2. **Advanced Shadow Detection**: Implement embedding-based darkness recognition
3. **Light Path Memory**: Save and restore illuminated thinking sessions
4. **Brightness Metrics**: Measure real-time illumination performance
5. **Adaptive Lighting**: Learn optimal brightness patterns for different thinking types

## Technical Achievements

- **Zero-copy JSON parsing** with serde
- **Async/await support** with Tokio
- **Type-safe MCP protocol** implementation
- **Real-time monitoring** without performance impact
- **Memory-safe** metacognitive algorithms

The project successfully demonstrates that Rust's performance characteristics make it ideal for implementing real-time cognitive illumination systems that can shine light on AI reasoning paths without dimming response times.
