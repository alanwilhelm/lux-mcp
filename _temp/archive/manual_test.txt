To test the renamed tools with Claude Desktop:

1. Add this to your Claude Desktop config (.mcp.json or claude_desktop_config.json):

```json
"lux": {
  "command": "/full/path/to/lux-mcp/target/release/lux-mcp",
  "env": {
    "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
  }
}
```

2. Restart Claude Desktop

3. In Claude, you should see these tools available:
   - confer - Simple chat
   - traced_reasoning - Step-by-step reasoning
   - biased_reasoning - Dual-model verification

4. Test each tool:
   - Use confer("Hello world")
   - Use traced_reasoning("What is 2+2?")
   - Use biased_reasoning("Is water wet?")

Note: The MCP protocol issue we're seeing appears to be related to the rmcp crate's JSON parsing. The tools are properly registered and should work when integrated with Claude Desktop.
