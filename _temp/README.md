# Temporary/Archive Directory

This directory contains files moved from the root directory during cleanup to maintain a cleaner project structure.

## Directory Structure

- **debug/** - Debug logs and output files
- **configs/** - Example configuration files
- **docs-archive/** - Superseded or temporary documentation
- **tools/** - Utility scripts (debug, check, verify scripts)
- **archive/** - One-off and temporary files
- **test-scripts/** - Standalone test scripts (NOT integration tests which remain in /tests)

## Policy

Files in this directory are:
- Not essential for building or running the project
- May be referenced for historical purposes
- Can be deleted if no longer needed
- Should NOT be moved back to root without good reason

See MOVED_FILES_INDEX.md for a complete list of moved files and their original locations.
